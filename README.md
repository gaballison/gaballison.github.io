**The Haunted Mansion**

`00:29` When hinges creak in doorless chambers, and strange and frightening sounds echo through the halls; whenever candle-lights flicker and the air is deathly still, that is the time when ghosts are present, practicing their terror with ghoulish delight.  

`00:54` Welcome, foolish mortals, to the Haunted Mansion. I am your host. Your ghost host. [sinister laughter]  

`01:08` Kindly step all the way in, please, and make room for everyone. There's no turning back now.
